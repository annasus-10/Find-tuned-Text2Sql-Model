# Fine-tuned Text2SQL Model

## Overview

This project involves **fine-tuning a Text2SQL model** specifically designed to work with custom databases. The aim is to develop a system that can transform natural language queries into SQL queries, which are then used to fetch the answers from a database. The answers are processed further with another language model (LLM) that applies natural language processing techniques to generate a human-friendly response to the user's question.

For reference, you can read more about improving Text2SQL models [here](https://hackernoon.com/improving-text-to-sql-with-a-fine-tuned-7b-llm-for-db-interactions).

## Use Case

The model is being developed as a part of a **chatbot system**. Here's how it works:
1. **User Query**: The user asks a question (e.g., "What are the major topics in Introduction to Cloud Computing (CE 4229)?").
2. **Text-to-SQL**: The model converts the user's query into an SQL query that can be run against a specific database.
3. **Database Query**: The generated SQL query is executed on the database to retrieve the relevant data.
4. **NLP Processing**: Another LLM processes the raw database results and generates a user-friendly response to the original query.

This two-step process (SQL query generation + NLP response generation) is key to making the chatbot more powerful and responsive.

> **Note**: A diagram could be added here to better visualize the flow of data from user input to final response.

## Approach

### Generating Sample Data

The first part of the project involves creating a **training dataset** for the model. While there are many pre-existing Text2SQL datasets available (e.g., the Spider dataset, which can be found [here](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider)), this project focuses on **fine-tuning a custom model** specifically for a given database schema.

The motivation for using a custom database for training is that the model will perform better when it is fine-tuned on queries that are directly relevant to your use case. Therefore, this project generates a set of 500 custom **natural language and SQL query pairs**.

### Generating Custom Queries

To generate the training data:
1. I used **Ollama** (a large language model) and **psycopg2** (for connecting to PostgreSQL) to generate SQL queries based on a schema.
2. The key to creating high-quality training data was **prompt engineering**. By fine-tuning the prompt to ensure the LLM (Ollama, in this case) understood the task correctly, I was able to produce useful query pairs.
3. I started with different versions of `generate_training_data.py` and `samples.json`, iterating on the prompts to arrive at the final version with 500 working sample pairs.

### Performance

The training data generation took about **6 hours** on my basic laptop setup, but this process can be significantly faster with a better machine or by leveraging cloud resources. 

The training process itself (on the fine-tuning model) will also benefit from higher compute resources, but generating the samples is the most time-consuming part.

### Files in the Repository

- **`generate_training_data.py`**: This script generates training data by querying the database and converting the queries to a natural language form and vice versa.
- **`samples.json`**: This file contains the generated natural language queries and their corresponding SQL queries.
  - Multiple versions of the data generation process are included, as the final working version required tweaking the prompt.
  - The final version contains **500** sample pairs used for fine-tuning.

### Fine-Tuning the Model

Once the training data is ready, it can be used to fine-tune a Text2SQL model. In this case, the LLM used for query generation is **Ollama**, which powers the conversion of natural language into SQL queries.

To fine-tune a model, the 500 sample pairs can be passed to the training script or directly integrated into your LLM setup.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **psycopg2**: To connect to a PostgreSQL database
- **Ollama API**: For generating natural language queries and SQL
- **PostgreSQL**: Custom database for generating training data

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install psycopg2
```

You will also need access to the **Ollama API** for generating text-based queries and a **PostgreSQL** database to run queries against.

## Next Steps

1. **Fine-Tune the Model**: After generating the dataset, fine-tune your Text2SQL model on the 500 custom queries and SQL pairs.
2. **Integrate with Your Chatbot**: Once the model is fine-tuned, you can integrate it into your chatbot, where the model will generate SQL queries in response to user queries.
3. **Enhance with NLP**: After the query results are fetched, use a second LLM or NLP model to format the response in a human-readable format.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to **fine-tune** a Text2SQL model for a **custom database schema** and use it in a **chatbot system** to convert natural language queries into SQL queries. The approach focuses on generating training data from your own database, making the fine-tuned model more relevant and accurate for your specific use case.
